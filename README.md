Notes
------------------
This is a straight-up port of the previous plugin [sbt-liquibase-plugin](https://github.com/sbtliquibase/sbt-liquibase-plugin), with slight
updates to work with SBT 1.

I have found other similar plugins to be either abandoned or not updated frequently, which makes it very hard to rely on them for bug-fixes and features.

Acknowledgements
---------------
Inspiration from previous work done by others on the following projects was an enormous help.
 * [sbt-liquibase-plugin](https://github.com/sbtliquibase/sbt-liquibase-plugin) for the 0.13.x version
 * sbt-liquibase plugin for sbt 0.11/0.12 (thanks for actually making this plugin in the first place!)
